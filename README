Abstraction layer to EEPROM ICs like 24AA/24LC.

1. DESCRIPTION

This library designed to work on top of ChibiOS/RT. It abstracts access to
EEPROM like a regular file.

2. LIMITATIONS

* Only one EEPROM IC.
* Maximum capacity of EEPROM is 65536 bytes.

All limits can be easily expanded. 

For a moment it supports only I2C interfaced chips and tested with my 24LC512.
Support of SPI chips (25AA/25LC) can be easily added too.

3. USAGE

* Open 24aa.h and tune constants for you needs.
* Include eeprom.h file to your project.
* Define file object of a EepromFileStream type.
* Open it with EepromOpen() function.

Now you can access to EEPROM array like to a regular file with functions:
- chFileStreamRead()
- chFileStreamWrite()
- chFileStreamGetPosition()
- chFileStreamSeek()
etc. 

Examples of usage and checking the returning parameter you can found in
eeprom_testsuit.c
