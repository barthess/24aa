Abstraction layer for EEPROM ICs like 24AA/24LC.

1. DESCRIPTION

This library designed to work on top of ChibiOS/RT. It abstracts access to
EEPROM like a regular file(s).

2. LIMITATIONS

* Only I2C.
* Maximum capacity of EEPROM is 65536 bytes.
* No 'RAID' like combining

3. USAGE 
3.1. C

* Include eeprom.h file to your project.
* Create eeprom_conf.h (sample included) in your project.
* Define file object of a EepromFileStream type
  and config structure for it.
* Open them with EepromOpen() function.

Now you can access to EEPROM array like to a regular file with functions:
- chFileStreamRead()
- chFileStreamWrite()
- chFileStreamGetPosition()
- chFileStreamSeek()
etc. 

Examples of usage and checking the returning parameter you can found in
eeprom_testsuit.c

3.2. CPP 
Example of CPP code you can find in 'cpp_example' directory. Also 
check 'eeprom_testsuit.cpp'.

Note! You have to provide fucntions eeprom_led_on() and eeprom_led_off()
in your eeprom_mtd_conf.h If you do not need such functionality just 
define empty macros.
